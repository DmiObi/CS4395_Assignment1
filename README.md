# CS4395 Assignment 1

## What this program does: 
It parses a text file that has the following format <Last,First,Middle Initial,ID,Office phone>.
Then it creates objects with this data and puts those objects into a hashtable. 
When the program is done filling the hashtable, it prints every object in an easily readable format. 

## How to run the program:
In order to run this program, you need to pass a parameter, which is the pathway to the text file. It's recommended that you create a folder named "data" and put that text file inside of that folder. An example of a possible parameter, in this case, would be "data/file. next" 

## What did I learn in this assignment? 
I learned how to use regular expressions (ReGex) for finding patterns in a text. In addition, I learned how to work with text in general: opening text files as well as parsing them. One thing that was a review for me was building classes in python as well as using data structures like a hash table.
